Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

- Morning stand up
- Check in every 2 hours
- End of day merge (at a minimum)
- Major feature merging

NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.

- Make the execution plan, and any new idea's or goals need to be discussed with the whole team before moving forward with it.

## Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Describe at least:

What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

- 1:1 conversation with that person => Group converstion => JB

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

- Morning stand up discussion
- Treat others how you want to be treated

How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

- Talk it out during the morning stand up, ensuring everyone is on the same page

How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

- A group discussion, we have an odd number of members and can take tough decisions to a vote

How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

- Using our teaching staff starting with JB

## Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

- 9:30am - 5:00pm
- After hours as available

What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

- Slack, Discord

How often will you take breaks?

What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

- We plan to make decisions with group members present and important decisions for the MVP will be made with the full support of at least the majority of the group

How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

- Be polite and give everyone a turn to talk during stand up

## Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

Describe at least:

How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

- Thoroughly plan our work flow and whiteboard to identify tasks, we will assign tasks to align with 1 person's strength, and 1 person who wants to grow in that area to ensure both an efficent and learning environment.

What project management tool will be used?

- Trello
